    <content type="html"><![CDATA[In just 12 hours PyCon US 2017 starts. This is an exciting conference because there will be a bunch of Home Assistant developers and users there being able to meet in person.

Just like last year, we'll be hosting a [Home Assistant Open Space](https://us.pycon.org/2017/events/open-spaces/). Please stop by to ask any questions you have to the available developers. ~~We haven't reserved a slot yet but will do so tomorrow. We'll update this post and announce it on social media as we know time and location.~~ **First open-space will be Friday at 4pm in room B112.**

We will also be taken part in the [development sprints](https://us.pycon.org/2017/community/sprints/) from Monday-Wednesday. You only need to bring a laptop. We'll help you get set up with a dev environment and you can be coding on top of Home Assistant in no time. ~~Exact location inside the conference center to be announced.~~ **We are sitting in room A108.**

On a final note, the Home Assistant community is very very active so don't take it personal if we don't remember your name, issue or contribution.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[I like Python. It's a clean easy to read, easy to learn language. Yet when you use it for some time you still find more features to improve your coding. What I probably like most about Python is the community and the great libraries that already exist. Often solving a problem means including a pre-existing library and writing some glue code. That makes it quick to get things up and running.

I just gave a talk on how you can run Python to automate your home (yes with Home-Assistant) but also with [MicroPython]. Micropython allows you to run Python on your DIY sensors and switches around your home. Python everywhere - even on the chips that give Home-Assistant the data to be awesome.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[You may already know from our social media channels and the release blog post for 0.41: We are now an award-winning Open source project. The jury of the [Thomas-Krenn-Award][award] put us on the 2nd place. This is an awesome achievment for an independent community project.

I would like to thanks all contributors. Your endless effort made this possible.

The prize beside the very nice trophy contains hardware and we want to give that hardware partically away. We won four [Low Energy Server v2 (LES)][LES] units with an Intel Celeron N2930, 8 GB of RAM, and a mSATA of 128 GB (one unit with 64 GB). We were thinking about to keep one of those units in Europe and one in North America for testing and to use during workshops and events. But the other two will go to interested parties.

As a raffle would be to easy, we make a contest out of it. This means that we are looking for your application. Of course, we would like to see those systems goes to active or future developers who can justify their need for one of the systems to run CI, UI tests, public accessible Home Assistant demo instances, etc. At the other hand we would like to keep it open, to see with what people are coming up. Please participate as well if you are planning to automate the public school of your kids with 1000 switches or light, need a server to run it, and want to provide regular feedback about the user experience.

Create an entry in our [Forum][forum]. Be creative and use your imagination.


### <a class='title-link' name='the-details' href='#the-details'></a> The details 

- Jury: The Home Assistant community
- Dead line: April, 23 2017 - 23.59 UTC
- Voting period: April, 24th till April, 30 2017 - 23.59 UTC

The decision of the jury will be final. If there will be a dispute then the Top-5 commiter of the Home Assistant organisation on Github will decide. Also, we reserve us the right to ban applications if we suspect cheating or unfair methods. Updates will be available in the [Forum][forum] and on [Twitter][twitter].

Keep in mind that you may have to pay the fee for customs handling and the import duty by yourself. The plan is to ship the hardware from Germany. If you are located in a country with import/export regulations, we may not be able to ship the hardware to you.
